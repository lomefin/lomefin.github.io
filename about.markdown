Hi, I'm Leo, nice to meet you
-----------------------------

![This is me](/leo-small.webp)

I'm a software developer, who enjoys designing and building new solutions, keeping the focus on the final user but I keep enjoying the delights of having an elegant and speedy solution.

Several companies have already worked with me and my software company, [AvispaTech](https://www.avispa.tech) which I'm the proud founder.

I've been in several hobbies and activities, from filmography and photography (I still miss Flickr's days of glory), to folklore dancing, and woodworking.
